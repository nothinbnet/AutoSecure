# AutoSecure: AI-Powered IT Compliance Assistant 

AutoSecure is a lightweight, simulated IT compliance assistant built in Python. Inspired by real world internal IT and security workflows, this tool is designed to emulate core functionalities of an AI assistant used for managing compliance, device security, and access control across a modern hybrid organization.

> / Built for demo purposes

Features
AutoSecure features compliance status of user devices in the enterprise. It checks for encryption, firewall compliance, and any missing updates and lets you know which devices fail these compliance checks. It also checks user roles for any unauthorized privilege escalations. AutoSecure also outps a consolidated SOC 2 style audit report.
